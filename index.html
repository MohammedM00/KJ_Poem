      Heart of A Queen<br>
      A blazing fire burned like the sun,<br>
      But all she claimed was that God is one.<br>
      So believe in Him He won’t ever leave you astray,<br>
      Blindfold your eyes to the end of the way.<br><br>
      Your kindness has beauty, that this colored sky began to drip,<br>
      But It brought colors to my eyes, the most perfect gift.<br>
      If you only knew what your power was worth,<br>
      You can be one of the best women to walk this earth.<br><br>
      Deceive your gifts for that nameless stone,<br>
      So Komal you can be like a Queen on her throne.<br>
      To a person who is a mystery,<br>
      But I would gladly read you in my history.<br><br>
      They might see you as a dead light,<br>
      But have they not seen a seed out on the ground grow and rise?<br>
      Even if the seas split, the sky cracks open,<br>
      No matter how our story ends,<br>
      I will keep you in my prayers, for we are forever destined friends.<br><br>
      I’m yet to see the things I have never seen,<br>
      To witness my majestic Queen!
